  <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
  <p></p>
  <div><b><br>Don't free-tier and premium members get mob&nbsp;programming time with AV Mentors already?</b></div>
  <div><b><br></b></div>
  <div>Agile Ventures supports ad-hoc pairing and mobbing all round the world, but we can't guarantee that any free-tier or premium member will necessarily get pairing or mobbing time with a senior AV mentor. &nbsp;We've had feedback from members that it would be easier to progress&nbsp;if they could rely on having a senior AV mentor available at a particular time and date specified in advance. &nbsp;If we're going to ask senior AV mentors to commit to being available&nbsp;in advance we need to be able to compensate them for their efforts. &nbsp; We've tried operating on a purely ad-hoc basis for several years, and&nbsp;Premium Mob&nbsp;membership&nbsp;is designed to increase the chances of successful learning and good progress on the charitable projects that we support&nbsp;by compensating&nbsp;senior AV members for committing their time.&nbsp;</div>
  <div><br></div>
  <div>
    <div><b>Can I use time in mobbing sessions with my Mentor to talk about Professional Development rather than coding?</b></div>
    <div><br></div>
    <div><p>Mob sessions are focused on&nbsp;coding skills.&nbsp; Usually the professional development support will&nbsp;be handled over Slack and email text chat, with the Mentor and Premium Mob member passing back and forth a planning document. &nbsp;If you would like face to face time with a Mentor please consider upgrading to <a href="/premium_f2f">Premium&nbsp;F2F</a>.</p></div>
  </div>
  <div><br></div>
  <div><b>Premium Mob&nbsp;is more than twice the&nbsp;cost of Premium. &nbsp;How come?</b></div>
  <div><br></div>
  <div>The main cost of Premium Mob&nbsp;is the time of the Senior&nbsp;AgileVentures Mentor who will work with you for an hour a month&nbsp;in mobbing sessions to improve your pairing, coding and project management skills; as well as discussing your professional development needs. &nbsp;We need to compensate the Mentors who put in their time to help you.</div>
  <div><br></div>
  <div>
    <div><b>Will my Premium Mob&nbsp;membership&nbsp;auto-renew each month?</b></div>
    <div><br></div>
    <div>Yes, you'll be charged each month automatically - please email&nbsp;<a href="http://www.agileventures.org/info@agileventures.org">info@agileventures.org</a>&nbsp;if you would like to cancel your subscription.</div>
  </div>
  <div><b><br></b></div>
  <div><b>£25/month is a lot of money for me, surely you want Premium Mob&nbsp;to be affordable to everyone, everywhere?</b></div>
  <div><br></div>
  <div>Of course we do; however we also want to make our operation sustainable. &nbsp;If you can't afford&nbsp;£25/month please contact&nbsp;<a href="mailto:info@agileventures.org">info@agileventures.org</a>&nbsp;and we will see if we can find sponsorship to cover some or all of the costs of your Premium Mob&nbsp;membership.</div>
